# PAPAYA

### We rise by lifting others

www.papaya.com

A responsive web app that connects volunteers to nearby events held by charities, local communities and other volunteers. 

After moving to a new city, there was a noticable lack of websites that held information of events in the local area. After googling multiple different websites, eventually it was decided to create one website that holds all the local information in one place, where volunteers can search for events and organisations can upload events.

The website was built during the final weeks of a Le Wagon bootcamp using Ruby, Rails, HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), PostgreSQL and Heroku.
